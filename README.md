# VocaBoost - GRE Vocabulary Highlighter

Install this extension on [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gre-vocabulary-highlighte/gfkmbmplhjdoejicgmaldndkcnnpplho).

The goal of this project is to assist non-native English speakers in preparing for the GRE exam. When a user is browsing webpages, all the GRE vocabularies are highlighted. A popup window with definitions, examples, and a link to the Cambridge Dictionary is displayed when the mouse hovers/clicks the highlighted word.

Users can add/remove words from their collection by clicking the star icon, and review their word list by clicking the extension's icon in the browser toolbar.

Users can login with Google account (just click the button and they are good to go) to save all the collected words and setting!

Users can also change the highlight color, the popup window's font size, and the language of the dictionary by clicking the extension icon on the toolbar.

There are about 1500 most common GRE vocabulary words collected.

# Vocabulary Highlighter

The goal of this project is to assist non-native English speakers in preparing for the GRE exam. When a user is browsing webpages, all the matched words are highlighted. A popup window with definitions, examples, and a link to the online Cambridge Dictionary is displayed when the mouse hovers/clicks the highlighted word.

Users can change the highlight color, the popup window's font size, and the language of the dictionary by clicking the extension icon on the toolbar.

Currently, there are about 1700 most common GRE vocabulary words collected. The collection of words will continue to increase.
